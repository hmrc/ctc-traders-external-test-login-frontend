        To test NCTS Phase 5, you need to create a user for our sandbox.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        The NCTS sandbox is a test version of NCTS. It looks just like the live service but it is for testing purposes only. Just you and the other testers can see it.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        This means any declarations or notifications you make in the sandbox are mock transit forms - they will not be sent to the customs office.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
        If you already have a test user, <a class="govuk-link" target="_blank" href="/ncts-p5-sandbox/sign-in">sign in here</a>
    </p>
